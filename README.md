# MarketSpotter
Nano Terminal Challenge

This is a Terminal MarketList creator experience, if you want to create MarketLists you should try using our code. 
We've also implementated a file exportation to your Desktop, a .txt will be created if you want. 
There was also an integration made with the Apple Notes application, once you run the code you'll see that there is a feature where you can choose to open your list in Notes.

OBSERVATION:
- Make sure to run these files togheter as an xcode project in Xcode, otherwise we don't guarantee it's going to work.

If you have have questions or curiosity, feel free to reach on any social media or email.
